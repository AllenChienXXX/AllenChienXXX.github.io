                Motivation:<br><br> 
                Throughout my journey of learning and applying AI & Machine Learning, I encountered a challenge: the absence of an open-source library in C/C++ for Supervised Learning algorithms. Driven by my passion for Support Vector Machines and the underlying mathematics, I made the decision to embark on the task of building such a library from scratch.<br><br>
                The journey has been both lengthy and enjoyable. I encountered several challenges along the way, each of which I successfully addressed. Despite the algorithm functioning perfectly, I opted to use OpenGL for display, and I am currently focused on refining the accuracy of the display, an aspect that continues to be a work in progress.<br><br>
                As of now, this project is limited to binary classification; however, it has demonstrated an impressive capability by achieving 100% accuracy on linearly separable datasets.<br><br>
                I am committed to further developing this project and aspire to extend its capabilities to handle multiple classifications simultaneously.

                Motivation:<br><br>
                During my research collaboration with Dr. Khethavath on phishing email filtering, I have chosen to publish my findings on HuggingFace. The objective is to showcase how Supervised Learning techniques respond to various types of features present in contemporary emails.<br><br>
                I utilize Streamlit as the user interface, enabling users to upload their emails in the .eml file format. Through this interface, they can then interactively explore:<br><br>
                1.What are the features extracted?<br>
                2.Whether it's a phishing email or not based on model prediction?<br><br>
                Throughout my research, the models I trained have consistently achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 80%. I am committed to ongoing refinement, ensuring the continued improvement and optimal performance of the models.
