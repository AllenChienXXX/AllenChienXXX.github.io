                Motivation:<br><br> 
                During my journey learning and utilizing AI & Machine Learning, I came across a problem where there’s no open source library in C/C++ for Supervised Learning algorithms. Since I am passionate about Support Vector Machine and the math behind it, I decided to start it from scratch.<br><br>
                The process is long but enjoyable, I came across several problems and I was able to solve them. I use OpenGL for display, but even though the algorithm works perfectly well, the display was not accurate and this is what I’m still working on.<br><br>
                This project can only do binary classification so far, but it is able to achieve 100% accuracy on linear separable datasets.<br><br>
                I will continue work on this and hopefully I can make it to do multiple classifications at the same time.

                Motivation:<br><br>
                During my time doing research with Dr. Khethavath on phishing email filtering, I decided to publish my work on HuggingFace and show how Supervised Learning techniques react to different types of features that exist on modern emails.<br><br>
                I use streamlit as the user interface, and allow users to upload their email as a .eml file and see:<br><br>
                1.What are the features extracted?<br>
                2.Whether it's a phishing email or not based on model prediction?<br><br>
                Throughout my research, the models I trained are able to achieve more than 80% accuracy. I will continue to work on this and make sure it works perfectly fine.
