    <div class="container">
        <p>Allen is an undergraduate student passionate about AI and Machine Learning. He is currently working on Reinforcement Learning(RL) with Dr. Anita Raja at Hunter College, his research goal is to find an optimal solution for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning(MARL) that is flexible to implement and efficient in different kinds of scenarios.</h3>

        <p>He has worked on Supervised Learning(SL) and Deep Learning(DL) from 2021 to 2023, he has submitted a paper to ICMLA2023, the paper is about Phishing Email Filtering with various SL & DL methods. He also has worked with Large Language Models(LLMs) in the past, and is familiar with their structures and their implementation. </h3>
            
        <p>Allen is passionate about creating technologies that could impact the world and benefit the society, his next step is to implement MARL on Robotics.</h3>
